    <h1>Blueberry Dutch Baby</h1>
    <img src="blueberry-dutch-baby.jpeg">
    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>You're in for a huge treat with this blueberry studded baked pancake--it's rich and satisfying but surprisingly light tasting. The true magic of a Dutch baby is the contrast of texture between the crispy, crusty outside and the soft, custardy, fruity center. This version is not only gorgeous and delicious, but it's fun and simple to make! There's no sugar in the batter, so all the sweetness comes from the berries and the powdered sugar. For a sweeter version, serve with maple syrup like regular blueberry pancakes.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup packed all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon fine salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>⅔ cup milk, at room temperature</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons clarified butter, melted</li>
        <li>⅓ cup fresh blueberries, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>½ Meyer lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons powdered sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup, or to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Combine flour, salt, vanilla extract, eggs, and milk in a high-speed blender. Blend on high speed until completely smooth and very thin, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Heat a 9- or 10-inch cast iron skillet over high heat. Pour clarified butter into the skillet and use a pastry brush to grease the sides. Heat butter until just starting to smoke.</li>
        <li>Quickly and carefully pour the batter into the center of the skillet, then sprinkle blueberries over top. Transfer skillet to the center of the preheated oven and bake until browned and nicely puffed, 20 to 25 minutes. </li>
        <li>Carefully remove from the oven and immediately brush the top with melted butter</li>
        <li>Cut in wedges to serve and drizzle with maple syrup.</li>
    </ol>
