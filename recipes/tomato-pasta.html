    <h1>Tomato Pasta</h1>
    <img src="tomato-pasta.webp">
    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Roasting enhances the flavors of any vegetable, 
        but seems to add a wonderful, 
        rich sweetness when done with cherry tomatoes.
         This recipe takes that sweetness, complements it with fresh herbs and a touch of heat from red pepper flakes, 
        with some low-fat ricotta to smooth it all out.
         I topped it with some salty, nutty Pecorino cheese.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds red cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>½ pound tomatoes, roughly chopped        </li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ cup julienned fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano</li>
        <li>12 ounces whole wheat linguine</li>
        <li>½ (16 ounce) container low-fat ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup finely shredded Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Step 2: Combine all tomatoes, garlic, chicken broth, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper in a large, glass baking dish; toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Step 3: Roast in the middle of the preheated oven, stirring regularly, until tomatoes are tender, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and stir in basil, parsley, and oregano.</li>
        <li>Step 4: When the tomatoes have been roasting for about 35 minutes, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 7 minutes (cook for 2 minutes less than package directions.) Drain and return to the pot.</li>
        <li>Step 5: Add the roasted tomatoes and herbs to the linguine and cook over medium-low heat for 2 minutes. Add ricotta cheese and stir until melted and smooth.</li>
        <li>Step 6: Serve topped with Pecorino Romano cheese.</li>
    </ol>
